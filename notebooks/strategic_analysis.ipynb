    "### **The Objective: Proving the Kessler Acceleration**\n",
    "We have successfully fused the physical tracking data (SATCAT) with operational intelligence (UCS) to create a unified \"Kinetic Master\" registry. Now, we move from engineering to **Strategic Analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tests the core hypothesis of the project: **\"The Kessler Acceleration.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are looking for evidence that the orbital environment has decoupled from historical linear growth and entered a self-sustaining exponential risk phase. We will quantify this through five strategic dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Double Threat:** Comparing the \"Visible\" population (Count) against the \"Kinetic\" reality (Mass).\n",
    "2.  **The 2014 Pivot:** Identifying the exact moment commercial launch cadence broke the historical trendline.\n",
    "3.  **The Kessler Canyon:** A high-resolution density mapping of Kinetic Energy ($E_k$) vs. Altitude to visualize the \"Deadly Ring.\"\n",
    "4.  **Geopolitical Footprint:** Attributing kinetic risk liability to specific state actors (US, CIS, PRC).\n",
    "5.  **The Zombie Index:** Quantifying the dormant threat of high-mass, operationally dead payloads (`is_zombie == 1`)."
