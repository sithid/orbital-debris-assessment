    "### **Analytical Note: The Mass Transparency Gap**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cumulative Mass curve presented in this study should be interpreted as a **Conservative Lower Bound Estimate**. Because high-fidelity mass data is often proprietary or classified, and largely non-existent for fragments, **82.8%** of the cataloged objects are currently assigned a mass of `NaN` in our master dataset (and treated as `0 kg` for this visualization).\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, the 'True' mass curve is significantly higher, driven by the thousands of unweighted Rocket Bodies and Inactive Payloads that remain in orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Future Intentions: Solving the Gap**\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve the limitations identified in the **82.8% Transparency Gap**, I plan to implement a multi-tiered mass estimation model:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Tier 1: Synthetic Mass Averaging**\n",
    "As a baseline, we can assign standardized weights based on historical averages for known categories to create a \"proxy\" mass:\n",
    "* **Rocket Bodies:** ~3,000 kg (Average for spent upper stages).\n",
    "* **Inactive Payloads:** ~1,200 kg (Standard bus size for historical comms/science sats).\n",
    "* **Debris Fragments:** ~0.5 kg (Conservative average for trackable fragments > 10cm).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Tier 2: RCS-Based Kinetic Modeling (Preferred)**\n",
    "To achieve higher granularity, I will explore **RCS-Based Modeling**. Radar Cross Section (RCS) provides a physical proxy for the size of an object, allowing us to estimate mass based on the object's \"radar footprint\" rather than a categorical average.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logic of RCS Inference:**\n",
    "Instead of a \"one-size-fits-all\" weight for debris, we use the RCS to estimate physical dimensions:\n",
    "* **Small RCS:** Estimated mass ~0.1 kg (e.g., small bolts or fragments).\n",
    "* **Medium RCS:** Estimated mass ~50 kg (e.g., solar panel fragments).\n",
    "* **Large RCS:** Estimated mass ~1,500 kg+ (e.g., large structural panels or unlisted payloads).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advantages:**\n",
    "* **Physics-Grounded:** Moves away from flat averages toward a model that scales with the actual physical size of the object.\n",
    "* **Granularity:** Allows us to distinguish between a small bolt and a massive structural fragment within the \"Debris\" category, providing a much more accurate picture of the total \"Kinetic Fuel\" in orbit."
