    "# Advanced Analysis & Statistics\n",
    "- **Comparative Velocity Modeling:** Visualize the kinetic energy difference between natural meteoroids (~20 km/s) and man-made orbital debris (~7.8 km/s).\n",
    "- **Density Threshold Mapping:** Create a \"Kessler Limit\" overlay to show exactly where man-made density exceeds the background natural environment.\n",
    "- **Risk Attribution:** Quantify the probability of a \"Mission Ending Strike\" from a 1cm man-made fragment versus a natural micrometeoroid of the same size.\n",
    "- **Predictive Tracking Decay:** Use Correlation Matrices to determine if object age is a leading indicator for \"unhealthy\" tracking status.\n",
    "- **Physical Risk Modeling:** Utilize RCS (Radar Cross Section) data to calculate the specific collision probability of \"Zombie Satellites\" versus standard debris fragments.\n",

    "# **Future Integration: Geospatial Analysis with GeoPandas**\n",
    "While the current analysis focuses on altitude and mass, the next logical step is to project these orbits onto Earth's surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "* Use `GeoPandas` to create a heatmap of satellite \"density\" over specific geographic regions.\n",
    "* Map the launch sites (from the UCS data) to see if launch location correlates with specific orbital congestion zones."
